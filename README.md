# force_directed_graphs
My experimental project on ploting and pandas

Followed the work of Austin Taylor (http://www.austintaylor.io/d3/python/pandas/2016/02/01/create-d3-chart-python-force-directed/)
to create this projecct.

This requires a big screen to view the whole of the graph..

Next things to do:

1.Make a 3D graph

2.Include a search bar to locate and highlight nodes

3.More info to be displayed on mouse hover
