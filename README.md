# force_directed_graphs
My experimental project on ploting and pandas

Followed the work of Austin Taylor (http://www.austintaylor.io/d3/python/pandas/2016/02/01/create-d3-chart-python-force-directed/)
to create this projecct.

This requires a big screen to view the whole of the graph..

How to run it for yourself : 

Run the Pandas_datagen.py file (inside it you can change the year to download that particular year's info)

It will create a JSON file named export.json in your directory

Now just open the index.html file in the browser you will be able to see the graph of the movies,actors,etc and their relationship
